# Bronze

### A game engine made in Rust based on [JudsonSS's game engine](https://github.com/judsonSS/Jogos) made in C++

The code will change as the course progresses, updating to the closest to the what is presented in the latest class in terms of functionality, but with changes that I feel are more suited to Rust and to my personal preferences.

### This project has been updated to use [rust-sfml](https://crates.io/crates/sfml)

This means that, in order for it to run correctly, it must meet the requirements set out in the crate instructions.

DLLs are included in the `bronze/include/` folder. There, there is more information on how to run the application on _Windows_.

I don't have any more information regarding other operating systems at the moment.
